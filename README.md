# Color-Detector-OpenCV
Color detection using OpenCV library.

A)	Title of the Project :
Color Detector 
     
B)	Problem Definition :
Color detection presentation software
   
C)	Introduction:

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Simple isn’t it? Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color names. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
        
D)	Hardware and Software Requirements :

1.	Hardware:
     ∙ Hard Disk minimum of 40 GB. 
     ∙ RAM minimum of 2 GB. 
     ∙ Dual Core and up ,15” Monitor.  
     ∙ Integrated webcam or external webcam (15 -20 fps).

2.	Software:
      ∙ Operating system- Microsoft Windows 7 SP 1 or above. 
      ∙ Microsoft Visual Studio Code. 
      ∙ MinGW and Visual Python compilers (for Windows). 
      ∙ Supporting Webcam Drivers.
      ∙ Libraries – OpenCV, Pandas, etc.

E)	Conclusion:

With the help of this Software one can –

●	 Detect the colour name of the pixel
●	 Get the exact name of the colour along with its RGB value 
●	 Compute the distance between each color
